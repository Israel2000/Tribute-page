   					  <h3>Here's a time line of Jesus's life according to 4 gospel:</h3>
<br>
						<div style="text-align: justify">
						<p>Jesus was Jewish, born by virgin Mary, was conceived by the Holy Spirit. Bethelem, Judea.</p>
						<p>Jesus' childhood home is identified in the gospels of Luke and Matthew as the town of Nazareth in Galilee, where he lived with his family. </p>
						<p>At one time he goes missing, his parent find him in the temple sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking questions, and the people are amazed at his understanding and answers; Mary scolds Jesus for going missing, to which Jesus replies that he must "be in his father's house" <b>(Luke 2:41–52)</b>.</p>
						<p>At the Age of 30, he was received bapistsim by John the Baptist(his cousin), where john preaching repentance and resubmit one self to bapitizm as symbol of returning to God's presences.</p>
						<p>In Mark, John baptizes Jesus, and as he comes out of the water he sees the Holy Spirit descending to him like a dove and he hears a voice from heaven declaring him to be God's Son <b>(Mark 1:9-11)</b>. This is one of two events described in the gospels where a voice from Heaven calls Jesus "Son", the other being the Transfiguration.</p>
						<p>One of his very first miracles happened at wedding turning water into wine, and later in the book of John, Jesus was seen walking on water.</p>
						<p>The spirit then drives him into the wilderness where he is tempted by Satan <b>(Mark 1:12–13)</b>. Jesus then begins his ministry after John's arrest <b>(Mark 1:14)</b>. </p>
						<p>Jesus preaches around Galilee, and in <b>Matthew 4:18–20</b>, his first disciples, who will eventually form the core of the early Church, encounter him and begin to travel with him. This period includes the Sermon on the Mount, one of Jesus' major discourses, as well as the calming of the storm, the feeding of the 5,000, walking on water and a number of other miracles and parables.</p>
						<p>In the Transfiguration <b>(Matthew 17:1–9, Mark 9:2–8, and Luke 9:28–36)</b>, Jesus takes Peter and two other apostles up an unnamed mountain, where "he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became dazzling white."A bright cloud appears around them, and a voice from the cloud says, "<b>This is my Son</b>, the Beloved; with him I am well pleased; listen to him" (Matthew 17:1–9). In 2 Peter 1:16–18, Peter himself affirms that he witnessed Jesus' Transfiguration, stating that the apostolic tradition is based on eyewitness testimony.</p>
						<p>Jesus clearly speak about the coming of God's kingdom; his own divine role as of the following statements: the bread of life, the light of the world, the gate of sheep, the good shepherd, the resurrection of the life, the way the life and the truth and the true vine.</p>
						<p><b>John 1</b>; Jesus is identified with the Word ("Logos"), and the Word is identified with theos ("God" in Greek);</p>
						<p><u>The Last Supper</u> is the final meal that Jesus shares with his 12 apostles in Jerusalem before his crucifixion. The Last Supper is mentioned in all four canonical gospels; Jesus takes bread, breaks it, and gives it to the disciples, saying, "This is my body, which is given for you". He then has them all drink from a cup, saying, "This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood" <b>(Luke 22:19–20)</b>. The Christian sacrament or ordinance of the Eucharist is based on these events.</p>
						<p>Jesus' crucifixion is described in all four canonical gospels. After the trials, Jesus is led to Calvary carrying his cross.</p>
						<p>Jesus is crucified between two convicted thieves, and according to Luke (but not Mark) one of them rebukes Jesus, while the other defends him. The Roman soldiers break the two thieves' legs (a procedure designed to hasten death in a crucifixion), but they do not break those of Jesus, as he is already dead. In John 19:34, one soldier pierces Jesus' side with a lance, and blood and water flow out.</p>
						<p>In the New Testement, after the Romans crucified Jesus, he was anointed and buried in a new tomb by Joseph of Arimathea but God raised him from the dead and he appeared to many people over a span of forty days before he ascended into heaven, to sit at the right hand of God.</p>
